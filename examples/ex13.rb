#Exercise 13 - Parameters, unpacking, Variables

#this unpacks the argument, so rather than holding all the arguments, it gets assigned to four variable you can work with.
first, second, third = ARGV

puts "Your first variable is : #{first} "
puts "Your second variable is : #{second}"
puts "Your third variable is: #{third}"

print "Type what you want to see on Screen?"
entered = gets.chomp()
puts " You entered '#{entered}' in the screen "
